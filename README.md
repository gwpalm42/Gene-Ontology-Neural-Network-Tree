# GONNT - Predict Unknown Gene Function

The project aims to learn and predict the function of genes using Gene Ontology (http://geneontology.org/) terms and kmer counting on the genes corresponding amino acid sequence. Rather than just predicted a leaf term, this model learns a path down the ontology to a leaf. This is a more robust method for learning and prediction. Rather than just out
